#### Notes:
1. Simple 150-line script implementing value investment basics based on Greenblatt's book, TLB that Beats the Market.
2. Companies were first screened based on market cap (2B+) â€” simple backtesting proved that micro (50M+) companies provided the possibility of a higher net return, but were too volatile in the short-term to consistently hold onto. Then, companies were ranked on two metrics. EBIT/EV and EBIT/Net Tangible Capital. 
3. The top twenty companies were compiled, and all utilities and financial stocks (mutual funds, banks, and insurance companies) were eliminated. The results are below.
